Immutable HAMT implementation in Go.

[HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie)
is a data structure popular as associative arrays (a.k.a. maps or dictionaries)
or sets.
Its immutable variant is adopted widely by functional programming languages
like Scala and Clojure to implement immutable but memory-efficient associative
arrays.
